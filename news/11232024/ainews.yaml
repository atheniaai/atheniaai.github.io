  fullContent: A US judge dismissed a case against OpenAI, ruling that the company is not liable for allegedly unlawfully removing copyright management information (CMI) when creating training datasets for its ChatGPT models. However, the plaintiffs, including Raw Story and AltNet, have been granted permission to amend their complaint.
